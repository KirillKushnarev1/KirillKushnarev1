I am a pre-doc at the [Centre for Economics, Policy and History](https://ceph.ie) at Trinity College Dublin.

I focus on macroeconomics and economic history. 

I work with microdata extracted from censuses and business directories to understand the drivers and consequences of technological change. I am also interested in broad questions of cross-country differences in the formation of upper-level human capital.

I hold an MSc with Distinction in Economic History (Research) from the London School of Economics and a BA in Economics from Plekhanov Russian University of Economics. 

I received the Plekhanov Award for Best Research Performance among the graduating cohort across all majors, as well as a commendation from the Russian Ministry of Education. My master's dissertation was awarded the ESCoE Prize for Best Dissertation.

Here is my CV.

My email is kushnark [at] tcd [dot] ie.
