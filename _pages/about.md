I am a pre-doc at the [Centre for Economics, Policy and History](https://ceph.ie) at Trinity College Dublin.

I focus on macroeconomics and economic history. I work with microdata extracted from censuses and business directories to understand the drivers of and resistance to technological change. I am also interested in broad questions of cross-country differences in the formation of upper-level human capital.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
